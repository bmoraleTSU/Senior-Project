# Senior-Project
This is a codebase to hold a Tennessee State University Senior Project that focuses on a procedurally generated path placed on a vertical structure in a 3D space using the Unity3D environment. We will be using Machine Learning to train a model that races the player down the vertical structure to add an element of extra difficulty.
